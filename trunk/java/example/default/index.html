  <h1>Hello MapReduce!</h1>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>This is an example Map Reduce that demos parallel computation. <br />
        For the purposes of illustration this MapReduce looks for collisions in
        Java's Random number generator. (There are not any.) <br /> Here a
        collision is defined as multiple seed values that when next is called
        produce the same output value. <br /> The input source is a range of
        numbers to test, and any collisions are logged and written out to a file
        in Google Cloud Storage. (Which in this case will be empty.) <br />

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>There is also a second more complex example that chains three
        MapReduces together:<br /> The first MapReduce creates some datastore
        entities <br /> The second MapReduce does some analysis on them <br />
        and the third MapReduce deletes them. <br /> On the whole it does not
        do anything useful, but it shows how to chain mapreduce jobs together,
        and how to interact with the datastore from mapreduce jobs. <br />
        It also gives an example of validating a request using a token. <br />
