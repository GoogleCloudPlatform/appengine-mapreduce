  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><Big>Random collisions example</Big><br />
        This example demonstrates parallel computation. It looks for collisions
        in Java's random number generator, <br />
        where a collision is defined as multiple seed values
        that produce the same output value when <code>next()</code> is called. <br />
        The input source is a range of numbers to test. Collisions are logged and
        written out to a file in Google Cloud Storage. <br />
        (No collisions occur so the file will be empty.) <br />
        <a href="/randomcollisions">Run the example.</a> <br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><br /><Big>Entity counting example</Big><br />
        The example shows how to â€œchain" MapReduce jobs together,
        running them sequentially, one after the other. <br />
        It runs three MapReduce jobs: <br />
        The first job creates some datastore entities,
        the second job analyzes them, and the third job deletes them. <br />
        The example also shows how to access the datastore from a
        MapReduce job, and how to validate a request using a token. <br />
