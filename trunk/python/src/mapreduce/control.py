    reader_spec: fully qualified name of mapper reader to use
    reader_parameters: dictionary of parameters to pass to reader. These are

    base_path: base path of mapreduce library handler specified in app.yaml.
      "/mapreduce" by default.
    queue_name: executor queue name to be used for mapreduce tasks.
    eta: Absolute time when the MR should execute. May not be specified
        if 'countdown' is also supplied. This may be timezone-aware or
        timezone-naive.
    countdown: Time in seconds into the future that this MR should execute.
